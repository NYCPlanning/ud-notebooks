    "Most precedents we found evaluated **roof pitch** using a basic raster-based slope calculation on a LiDAR-derived Digital Surface Model (DSM). (Kouhestani et al, 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct use of point clouds is also an option although it is much more computationally intensive with few benefits if pitch is the only desired variable. (Palmer et al, 2015), (Carette, 2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster-based aspect calculation can in theory be used to determine the direction of each individual roof pixel, and group them together, allowing for approximate **segmentation** of individual roof planes. However, this is not a suitable method for determinining areas of individual segments due to the need to offset the per-building pixel selection inward by 3-4 feet to account for noise in the DSM around roof edges. Narrow  or variable-pitch surfaces (curved) wouldn't be detected, and an area-based threshold below which detected surfaces wouldn't count toward the total would be difficult to define programmatically with traditional methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further research is needed to determine whether or not more reliable or accurate segmentation results could be obtained through direct use of building-level point clouds. Machine-learning methods, especially used in conjunction with existing building footrpints, might yield good results. (Microsoft)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total roof area** is approximately equivalent to the total footprint area. For regularly-sloped roofs, an estimate could be produced by multiplying footprint area by some correction factor based on average slope. Otherwise, a reliable vector-based segmentation method is needed (see discussion under segmentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Roof shading** can be determined using a raster-based hillshade calculation on a DSM. Calculating cumulative shade over time is computationally expensive as it requires summing the results of multiple queries over time. Location-specific calculations of the relevant time intervals between sunrise and sunset would need to be obtained. Finally, since even high-resolution DSMs are noisy/lumpy and are \"2.5D\" rather than truly 3D, more accurate results could potentially be obtained using 3D vector models (though not at scale). Precedents are still needed for this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "More accurate estimates of shading might benefit from direct use of point clouds or derived meshes, there is some overlap between these methods and those discussed below for 3d feature identification."

    "One method for building-level **albedo** is to use LiDAR return intensity as a proxy. Intensity measurements are for a single wavelength of light (1064 nm per Quantum Geospatial Report). The intensity value can be used to estimate albedo using a formula (CARSI Cool Roofs), although accurate results depend on the properties of surface materials. (Joerg et al, 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiband aerial imagery can be used to classify roof materials, for which detailed reflectance properties are already known. (Ban-Weiss 2014). However this method is not feasibile without a database of lab-measured values appropriate for the study region.\n",

    "Among other things, the Fire Code requires specific access and setbacks for venting and other firefighting purposes on low-slope roofs under 100'. According to Mayor's Office of Sustainability, FDNY already claims more rooftop space than most other fire departments in the US, and the proposed 2021 Fire Code revision will expand those requirements. Section 504 \"Building and Rooftop Access\" addresses access, 504.4 deals with specific access requirements for low-rise, low-slope roofs.\n",
