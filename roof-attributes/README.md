# Roof Attributes Datamining

## Setup

The notebooks for this project require a `.env` file at the project root used to store connection parameters for a remote PostgreSQL database. Using `.env.example` as a template, populate each of the necessary variables and rename the file `.env`.

If you are starting from scratch and need to set up a new database, you can use the scripts included with [`ud-tools-core`](https://github.com/nycplanning/ud-notebooks) to automatically load spatial data layers from NYC OpenData.
