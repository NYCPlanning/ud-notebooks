# UDTools Testing

These notebooks are meant to test geometry processing and zoning analysis functionality in `ud-tools-core`. Use them with the `udtools` conda environment which can be set up using instructions in that repo.

The easiest way to run these is inside vs code, where `ud-notebooks` contains a `.env` file providing the connection variables for postgres and is set as the workspace root. See `ud-tools-core` for an example `.env`.
