## Setup

Each set of notebooks provides an `environment.yml` file that can be used to install dependencies in a new conda environment. From inside the project directory, run `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

Once your environment is set up, activate it with `conda activate myenv`. Then you can run `jupyter lab` or open individual notebooks in VS Code to get started. Note that project-specific setup instructions may also apply, these are specified in a project-level `README`.
